The project regards a voting app.
There is a main page with login/signup, and the user can choose two
different roles when signing up: Voter or Manager.
Voter can only vote polls, Manager can create them.
Multiple polls are grouped into Poll Sessions.
When the user logs in, he sees different view depending on if he's a Voter or a Manager.
In the Manager page, he sees a list of the Poll Sessions he created, and he can create more; if he pres the View button of a specific
poll session, he goes into the Poll Session page, where he sees all the polls associated with that poll session, and he can create more; he also
sees a list of all the voters of this poll session, and he can add more.
When he clicks on a specific poll, he can see the state (CREATED,  STARTED, CLOSED, TALLIED) and the question with the possible choice; here
he can modify poll state, question and choices, and make tally.
In the Voter page, the voter sees all the Poll session he's registered to, plus a License square in the top-right corner; clicking on the license,
a popup opens up, and he can choose to request license or connect a license.
If the Voter clicks on any Poll session, he can see the polls of that poll session, and if voting is allowed, a button "VOTE" appears.
In the Vote page, the user sees the choices ( polls can be multiple or single choice), he select all the choices he wants, then he click a Submit button.
When he clicks the Submit button, choices freeze up, and then a password field and a Vote button appear; he enters the password, and click Vote, and vote is sent.
